## Description

Duration: weekend project

This is a personal gallery app that allows the user to neatly display pictures and descriptions. Each photo has a like button that tracks 'likes' from viewers and a delete button, both of which connect to the database. Users can add photos and descriptions via the webpage or directly into the database.

This app makes use of React components as well as material-UI for additional styling.
